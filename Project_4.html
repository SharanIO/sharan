                    In today's fast-paced world, robots are increasingly becoming valuable teammates in various industries. 
                    This project explores how we can make Boston Dynamics' Spot robot even more useful by giving it the ability to find and retrieve objects on its own.
                </p>
                <p class="section-description">
                    Imagine walking into a warehouse where Spot is quietly at work, identifying misplaced items and returning them to their proper locations. 
                    Or picture a scenario where Spot assists in a search operation, locating important objects in areas that might be challenging for humans to access.
                </p>
                <p class="section-description">
                    My project focused on improving two key aspects of Spot's functionality: its 'eyes' and its 'brain'. 
                    I worked on upgrading its vision system for accurate object detection and enhancing its navigation skills for efficient movement in various environments. By combining these improvements, I aimed to create a more capable and independent robot that could handle tasks with minimal human input.
