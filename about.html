                            My fascination with robotics began in my childhood, where I spent countless hours building and tinkering with mechanical toys. 
                            This early curiosity evolved into a passionate pursuit of understanding how machines could be made to interact intelligently 
                            with their environment. Growing up in India, I was surrounded by a rich culture of innovation and problem-solving, which 
                            deeply influenced my approach to engineering.

                        <p class="story-paragraph">
                            During my undergraduate years at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, I discovered my true calling in robotics engineering. 
                            The combination of mechanical engineering, computer science, and electronics opened up a world of possibilities. I led the 
                            university's robotics team, where we developed autonomous systems for various competitions, teaching me not just technical 
                            skills but also the importance of collaboration and leadership.
                        </p>

                        <p class="story-paragraph">
                            My journey took an exciting turn when I moved to the United States to pursue my Master's in Robotics at the University at Buffalo. 
                            Here, I've had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects in soft robotics, computer vision, and human-robot interaction. 
                            Each project has been a stepping stone, teaching me new approaches to solving complex engineering challenges while maintaining 
                            a focus on practical, real-world applications.
                        </p>

                        <p class="story-paragraph">
                            What drives me is the potential of robotics to transform lives and industries. Whether it's developing more intuitive 
                            human-robot interfaces or creating robots that can safely navigate complex environments, I'm passionate about pushing 
                            the boundaries of what's possible. I believe in creating solutions that are not just technically sophisticated but also 
                            accessible and beneficial to society.
                        </p>

                        <p class="story-paragraph">
                            Outside of my technical work, I'm an advocate for STEM education and regularly mentor aspiring roboticists. I believe in 
                            sharing knowledge and inspiring the next generation of engineers. When I'm not working with robots, you might find me 
                            exploring photography, practicing guitar, or hiking - activities that help me maintain a creative and balanced perspective 
                            in my engineering work.
