          <p>The manufacturing process involved careful consideration of the dimensions of the MG995 servo motors and the M3 countersunk screws, which are integral to the assembly of the robot's modules. 
            Each module was printed with a 15% infill, striking a balance between lightweight construction and structural integrity.</p><br>
          <h3>Control and Electronics</h3>
          <p>The heart of the snake robot's control system is the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a powerful and compact computer that enables advanced processing capabilities. 
            This is complemented by the PCA9685 board, which facilitates communication between the Jetson Nano and the servo motors through I2C.</p><br>
          <p>The servo motors, specifically the Tower Pro MG995 models, are responsible for the actuation of each joint in the robot. 
            They are connected in parallel and powered from the tail end of the robot, ensuring a streamlined and efficient setup.</p><br>
          <p>The control algorithms are meticulously developed to enable the robot to perform various gaits and movements, with parameters fine-tuned through both simulation and physical testing. 
            This ensures that the robot can adapt to different terrains and complete its tasks effectively.</p><br>
          <h3>Simulation</h3>
          <p>To ensure the robot's movements are precise and efficient, simulations were conducted using PyBullet, a real-time physics simulator popular for its accuracy and capability in robot simulation. 
            PyBullet provided a platform to test various gaits and movements, such as sidewinding and rotation, without the need for physical trials.</p><br>
          <p>The Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) was used to describe the robot's joints and links, allowing for a detailed simulation of its mechanics. 
            This process involved adjusting parameters such as joint angles, amplitudes, and offsets to mimic the natural movements of a snake.</p><br>
          <h3>Experimental Setup</h3>
          <p>The physical testing of the snake robot was conducted on different surfaces to evaluate its performance under various conditions. 
            These surfaces included a plain table, cardboard, and a yoga mat, each offering different levels of friction. 
            It was observed that the robot performed best on the plain table due to its optimal friction characteristics.</p><br>
          <p>The experiments focused on the robot's ability to execute the gaits simulated in PyBullet. 
            Adjustments were made to the control parameters to account for real-world factors such as friction and the weight distribution of the robot.</p><br>
          <h3>Results</h3>

          <h2>Collision Avoidance and Path Planning for Industrial Robot</h2>
          <p>The importance of collision-free trajectory generation lies in its potential to enhance the safety and effectiveness of robotic systems. 
            In scenarios where robots and humans coexist, ensuring that robots can avoid collisions is paramount for preventing accidents and facilitating seamless interaction. 
            This capability is also essential in industrial settings, where robots need to maneuver around obstacles and work in close proximity to human operators.</p><br>
          <p>Furthermore, the principles and algorithms developed in this project have broader implications beyond human-robot interaction. 
            They are applicable in autonomous vehicles, drone navigation, and even in surgical robotics, where precision and safety are of utmost importance. 
            By enabling robots to intelligently plan their paths and avoid obstacles, we can unlock new possibilities in automation and robotics, paving the way for more advanced and collaborative systems.</p><br>
          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <p>The main goals of this project were:</p><br>
          <p><strong>1. Detect Collisions:</strong>Create a system that can spot potential crashes between the robot arm and obstacles.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Plan Safe Paths:</strong>Develop methods for the robot to find and follow routes that avoid hitting anything.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Make Path Planning Efficient:</strong>Ensure the robot can quickly make decisions without sacrificing safety.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Improve Interaction with Humans:</strong>Build a robot that can safely work around people.</p><br>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>Achieving these goals was tough because::</p><br>
          <p><strong>1. Moving Obstacles:</strong>It's tricky for the robot to predict and dodge things that are moving.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Speed vs. Safety:</strong> The robot needs to make fast decisions but still be safe.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Reliable Sensors: </strong>The robot relies on accurate data from its sensors to avoid obstacles.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Finding the Best Path: </strong>It's hard to find a path that's both safe and doesn't take too long.</p><br>
          <h3>Methodology and implementation</h3>
          <p>The project encompassed three principal components:</p>
          <p><strong>Static Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:</strong></p>
          <p>I configured the robot to detect stationary obstacles within its operational space. 
            This involved setting up sensors and programming the robot to recognize obstacles in its path. 
            By accurately identifying the presence of obstacles, the robot could make informed decisions about its movement. 
            Utilizing Hermite interpolation, I devised a trajectory that would prompt the robot to halt if a potential collision was detected. 
            This precautionary measure ensured the safety of both the robot and its surroundings, preventing any possible accidents due to collisions.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Collision-Free Trajectory Generation for Static Obstacles:</strong></p>
            <p>My objective was to generate trajectories that circumvent collisions with static obstacles. 
              To achieve this, I focused on creating safe and efficient paths that the robot could follow while avoiding any obstructions in its environment. 
              I employed the Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM) technique to construct a network of safe paths. This involved generating random configurations and connecting them to form a graph of possible paths. 
              To identify the optimal route from the starting point to the destination, I implemented the A* search algorithm, which efficiently found the shortest path while ensuring collision avoidance.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Collision-Free Trajectory Generation for Dynamic Obstacles:</strong></p>
            <p>I explored strategies to navigate around moving obstacles, which presented a more complex challenge compared to static obstacles. 
              This required the robot to dynamically adjust its path in response to the changing positions of the obstacles. 
              Focusing on the RRT* and Temporal-PRM methods, I investigated their effectiveness in handling dynamic environments. 
              The Temporal-PRM approach, which adapts PRM for dynamic environments by forecasting obstacle movements, proved particularly efficacious. 
              It allowed the robot to plan its path with foresight, considering the future positions of the obstacles and adjusting its trajectory accordingly.</p><br>
            <p>Throughout the project, I utilized MATLAB for algorithm development and V-REP for conducting simulations. 
              This enabled me to rigorously test the robot's ability to maneuver safely in simulated environments, thereby demonstrating the viability of the proposed solutions. 
              The successful implementation of these methodologies underscored the potential of advanced path planning techniques in enhancing the safety and efficiency of robotic systems.</p>

            Overall, visual odometry is a foundational technology that enables autonomous systems to navigate and localize in challenging environments.</p><br>
          <p>The implementation of stereo visual odometry for the autonomous vehicle was approached with a systematic workflow, integrating ROS, Gazebo simulator, and stereo camera technology. 
            The process can be outlined in the following steps:</p><br>
          <p><strong>1. Simulation Environment Setup: </strong> Utilizing Gazebo, a simulation environment was created to mimic real-world scenarios, allowing for the testing and refinement of the visual odometry algorithms in a controlled setting.</p><br>
          <p><strong>2. Stereo Camera Calibration: </strong> The stereo camera mounted on the autonomous vehicle was calibrated to determine its intrinsic parameters. This step is crucial for accurate depth estimation and image rectification.</p><br>
          <p><strong>3. Image Aquisition: </strong> As the vehicle navigated through the simulated environment, images were continuously captured from the left and right cameras of the stereo setup.</p><br>
          <p><strong>4. Feature Detection and Matching: </strong> Key features were detected and matched between consecutive frames of the left and right camera images. This process is vital for tracking the movement of feature points and estimating the vehicle's motion.</p><br>
          <p><strong>5. Stereo Triangulation: </strong> The matched features, along with the camera's intrinsic parameters, were used for stereo triangulation to obtain 3D points in the environment, providing essential depth information.</p><br>
          <p><strong>6. Pose Estimation: </strong> The relative pose (position and orientation) of the vehicle was estimated by comparing the 3D points across consecutive frames, solving a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem to determine the vehicle's movement.</p><br>
          <p><strong>7. Odometry Computation: </strong> The estimated poses were accumulated over time to compute the vehicle's odometry, yielding a continuous estimate of its trajectory through the environment.</p><br>
          <p><strong>8. Visualization: </strong>  The estimated trajectory was visualized within the simulation environment to verify the accuracy and reliability of the visual odometry system, providing insights into the system's performance.</p><br>
